# Object-detection-system

Object Detection is a computer technology related to computer vision, image processing, that deals with detecting what and where objects are in images and videos. Object recognition is a key output of deep learning and machine learning algorithms.

# Libraries used:
-Open CV:
 OpenCV is a cross-platform library using which we can develop real-time computer vision applications. It mainly focuses on image processing, video capture and analysis including   features like face detection and object detection.
-Imutils :
 Imutils are functions to make image processing functions such as translation, rotation, resizing, and displaying Matplotlib images easier with OpenCV .
-Argparse :
 The argparse module is used to write user-friendly command-line interfaces. It also automatically generates help and usage messages, and issues errors when users give the program   invalid arguments.
-Numpy:
 NumPy is a Python library used for working with arrays.
 
 # Concepts used:
 -It uses deep convolutional neural networks to make predictions.
 We combine both the MobileNet architecture and the Single Shot Detector (SSD) framework, we arrive at a fast, efficient deep learning-based method to object detection.
 The MobileNet SSD was first trained on the COCO dataset which contains 20 objects.

# How to run:
 -Download all the files, unzip it and open it in any text editor(like sublime).
 -Open the command prompt.
 -After entering into the folder, run the command given in the .py file(the commented first line).
